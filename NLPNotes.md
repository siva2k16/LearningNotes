1. Key word or key phrase extraction methods like RAKE or YAKE
2. Key word extraction methods with transformer embeddings like KeyBERT
3. Topic models like LDA and BERTopic which uses transformers and c-TF-IDF

NLP and Elastic Search
NLP & Elasticsearch powered product search

https://github.com/viko-ai/nlp-search-poc

ElasticSearch is a search engine based on Lucene.
ElasticSearch uses parts of NLP (e.g., tokenization and stemming)

Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics.
