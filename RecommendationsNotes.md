Surprise is a Python scikit for building and analyzing recommender systems that deal with explicit rating data.

Provide various ready-to-use prediction algorithms such as baseline algorithms, neighborhood methods, matrix factorization-based ( SVD, PMF, SVD++, NMF), and many others. Also, various similarity measures (cosine, MSD, pearson...) are built-in.
