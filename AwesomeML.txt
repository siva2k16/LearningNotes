Explaining Black Box Models and Datasets
InterpretML  - InterpretML is an open-source package for training interpretable models and explaining blackbox systems.
ELI5  - "Explain Like I'm 5" is a Python package which helps to debug machine learning classifiers and explain their predictions.

Privacy Preserving ML
Google's Differential Privacy  - This is a C++ library of ε-differentially private algorithms, which can be used to produce aggregate statistics over numeric data sets containing private or sensitive information
PySyft  - A Python library for secure, private Deep Learning. PySyft decouples private data from model training, using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) within PyTorch.

Model and Data Versioning
MLflow  - Open source platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility and deployment.
Data Version Control (DVC)  - A git fork that allows for version management of models.
ClearML  - Auto-Magical Experiment Manager & Version Control for AI (previously Trains).

Model Training Orchestration
Kubeflow  - A cloud native platform for machine learning based on Google’s internal machine learning pipelines.
Hopsworks  - Hopsworks is a data-intensive platform for the design and operation of machine learning pipelines that includes a Feature Store - (Video).
ZenML  - ZenML is an extensible, open-source MLOps framework to create reproducible ML pipelines with a focus on automated metadata tracking, caching, and many integrations to other tools.

Model Serving and Monitoring
KServe  - Serverless framework to deploy and monitor machine learning models in Kubernetes - (Video).
Evidently  - Evidently helps analyze machine learning models during development, validation, or production monitoring. The tool generates interactive reports from pandas DataFrame.

AutoML
Katib  - A Kubernetes-based system for Hyperparameter Tuning and Neural Architecture Search.

Data Pipeline
Argo Workflows  - Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. Argo Workflows is implemented as a Kubernetes CRD (Custom Resource Definition).
